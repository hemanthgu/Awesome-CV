        \item {Make bug fixes in kernel and userspace for Nokia's eNB}
        \item {well versed with FPGA architectures required for re-configurable computing.}
        \item {Took up responsibility to support and maintain software stack to access and use FPGA based devices inside Platform Software.}
      	\subitem {- write kernel device drivers for controllers implemented on FPGA.}
      	\subitem {- write kernel drivers to initialize/program the FPGA themselves during system run-time.}
      	\subitem {- implement overlay device-trees for set of devices implemented on FPGA.}
      	\subitem {- During introduction of new FPGA, Co-ordinate with Board designers and FPGA designers to help make architecture decisions on Register layouts, Interrupts and Bus to be used to connect the FPGA to SoC's.}
        \subitem {- manage delivery and automate packaging of FPGA images (received from HW designers) inside LFS release cycles.}
    	  	\item {Implement Feature Requests from Product owner in the field of FPGA management within LFS (Feature management)}
    	  	\subitem {- Breakdown Feature requests into intended implementation.}
    	  	\subitem {- Design is converted into work packages}
    	  	\subitem {- Make effort estimations, derive dependencies between each work packages based on past experiences in implementation. This data is passed on to product owner for tracking until the release.}
    	  	\subitem {- Start implementing the packages one by one. and update the status.}
    	  	\item {Help in the transitioning of LFS startup of eNB from sysv init scripts to systemd based unit files.}
    	  	\item {Pick up functional programming like erlang for concurrent and hot-swappable code in userspace.}
