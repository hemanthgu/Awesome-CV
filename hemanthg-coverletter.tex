\begin{cvletter}

It's with great enthusiasm that I submit my application for "Embedded Developer in Positioning and Immersion" position as an embedded developer with over 8+ years of experience. I know my diverse skills and qualifications will make me an asset at ASML.

As you will see from the attached resume, I've built my career in variety of roles and industries, mostly as part of team in large scale system development. During my career I've not only just wrote code as programmer but also actively contributed towards hardware-software interface and device driver architecture, help in sprint planning by deriving task dependencies, initiate discussions with component vendors and customers to complete the requirements when missing, also being a lasting friend to my co-workers. I'm not only used to wearing multiple hats, I sincerely enjoy it.

In addition to being flexible and responsive, You need someone who's committed to high standards and is willing to adjust, change or completely redo current code to find the best way of implementing functions, and who lives and breathes embedded systems and robotics. And since all of that is my bread and butter. I'm thrilled at the possibility of being involved with ASML, a company which is deeply committed to its R\&D, developing products by having a strong customer and supplier relationships during its life-cycle. 

An opportunity to work and learn with best minds in mechatronics from multiple disciplines has come almost at the moment when ASML is upgrading its product code-base to make use of new languages. Which means challenging days are ahead. Would like to meet and discuss the value that I could add into the team. I appreciate your consideration and look forward to hear from you.
